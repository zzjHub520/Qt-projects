# Qt Remote Objects Protocol Versioning





Qt Remote Objects uses an internal protocol to pass data between processes and/or devices. The same protocol version needs to be used by all parties: if there is a mismatch, the connecting node will output a warning and the host node will not send any data.

Currently released versions:
