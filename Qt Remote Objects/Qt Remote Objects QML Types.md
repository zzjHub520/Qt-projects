# Qt Remote Objects QML Types





The QML types for [Qt Remote Objects](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtremoteobjects-index.html) provide the helper pieces needed to build a remote objects network. They are typically used in conjunction with custom-registered replica types that make up a specific network.

As an example, consider the following .rep file:

```
class MyType {
    PROP(QString myProp="Hello World")
};
```

The generated replica can be registered as a QML type:

```
qmlRegisterType<MyTypeReplica>("custom",1,0,"MyTypeReplica")
```

And then used from QML in conjunction with the base type Node:

```qml
import QtQuick 2.0
import QtRemoteObjects 5.15
import custom 1.0

Item {
    MyTypeReplica {
        id: myType
        node: Node { registryUrl: "local:registry" }
    }

    Text { text: myType.myProp }

    MouseArea {
        anchors.fill: parent
        onClicked: myType.pushMyProp("Updated Text")
    }
}
```

Note that by default you cannot directly assign to a replica property, but rather use a `push` function. This is due to the potential problems that arise from the mix of declarative programming and asynchronous updates. Specifically, we want to avoid issues like the following:

```
myType.myProp = "Updated Text"
console.log(myType.myProp) // logs "Hello World", as the new text has not yet been round-tripped
```

The QML types in this module can be imported into your application using the following import statement in your .qml file:

```
import QtRemoteObjects 5.15
```
